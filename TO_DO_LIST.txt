TO DO LIST

Guidelines: Claim a task by writing your name next to it. When the task is complete, write DONE next to it.

1. Query all mentions of elon musk on twitter from 2016-2018 (Garrett)
1.1 Clean the text of each tweet (Garrett)
1.2 Compute sentiment (Garrett)

2. Should we roll our independent variable 1 week backwards in order to assess our ability to predict the future?

3. Compute average sentiment of [day or week] for all tweets.

4. Make visualization

5. K-nearest neighbors regression model
5.1 5-fold cross validation

6. Repeat steps 1-5 for all stocks in FANG
	- Facebook
	- Amazon
	- Netflix
	- Alphabet (Google)
	Note: do we use CEO twitters, or Company twitters or both?

7. Make a bar graph for tweet count of different companies. This will tell us about the company's twitter presence.
It would also be nice to get the companies google presence. However, I don't think we have a way of accessing
this data.
We can also use this graph to see how twitter presence affects the correlation.
